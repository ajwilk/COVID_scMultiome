## Data availability
### scRNA-seq:

Raw data (fastq) and processed data (.rds count matrices) are deposited under GEO accession GSE174072

Raw and processed data from our earlier study (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0944-y) are deposited under an earlier accession (GSE150728)

Fully processed objects (Seurat .rds and AnnData .h5ad) are hosted at the COVID-19 cell atlas: https://www.covid19cellatlas.org/index.patient.html

This dataset will also be hosted for quick exploration on cellxgene shortly!

A processed Seurat .rds of granulocytes from a healthy donor (see Fig. S4) is hosted here: https://covid-scmultiome-public.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/201130--neut_combined.seu.rds
 
### scATAC-seq: 

Raw and processed data are deposited under GEO accession GSE174072
  
### CyTOF: 

FCS files and associated metadata are available at ImmPort (https://www.immport.org) under study accession SDY1708

FCS files are also hosted here:
